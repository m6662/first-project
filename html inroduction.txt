        1. Normal Elements
        2. Void Elements
        3. RC Data Elements

- Without using addtional attributes they can present.
- One they start presenting they can't end.
- You have to end element explicitly.
- You need an end token [tag]

        <p>        start token
        </p>        end token
        <b>
        </b>
